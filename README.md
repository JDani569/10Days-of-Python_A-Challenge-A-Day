#  10Days of Python A Challenge A Day
# Day 1
## Task 1
### Write a function called divide_or_square that takes one argument (a number), and returns the square root of the number if it is divisible by 5, returns its remainder if it is not divisible by 5. For example, if you pass 10 as an argument, then your function should return 3.16 as the square root.

## Task 2
### Write a function called longest_value that takes a dictionary as an argument and returns the first longest value of the dictionary. For example, the following dictionary should return – apple as the longest value.

# Day 2
## Task 1
### Write a function called convert_add that takes a list of strings as an argument and converts it to integers and sums the list. For example [‘1’, ‘3’, ‘5’] should be converted to [1, 3, 5] and summed to 9.

## Task 2
### Write a function called check_duplicates that takes a list of strings as an argument. The function should check if the list has any duplicates. If there are duplicates, the function should return the duplicates. If there are no duplicates, the function should return "No duplicates". For example, the list of fruits below should return apple as a duplicate and list of names should return "no duplicates".

# Day 3
## Task 1
### Write a function called register_check that checks how many students are in school. The function takes a dictionary as a parameter. If the student is in school, the dictionary says ‘yes’. If the student is not in school, the dictionary says ‘no’. Your function should return the number of students in school. Use the dictionary below. Your function should return 3.

## Task 2
### You are given a list of names above. This list is made up of names of lowercase and uppercase letters. Your task is to write a code that will return a tuple of all the names in the list that have only lowercase letters. Your tuple should have names sorted alphabetically in descending order.

# Day 4
## Task 1
### Write a function called only_floats, which takes two parameters a and b, and returns 2 if both arguments are floats, returns 1 if only one argument is a float, and returns 0 if neither argument is a float. If you pass (12.1, 23) as an argument, your function should return a 1.
